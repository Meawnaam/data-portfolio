# Churn Analysis with Power BI
This project utilized Power BI to investigate customer churn within the Telecom industry at the fiscal year-end of Q2 2022. The goal was to identify key factors contributing to churn and develop actionable insights for improved customer retention.

### Project goals
- Analyze customer churn trends over time.
- Identify factors influencing customer churn behavior.
- Monitor key business metrics including active users, revenue, churn rate, and potential revenue loss.

### Key Findings
- Customer retention : There was high churn at 27%. On the other hand, New customer acquisition was low at only 6%, potentially leading to long-term revenue decline.
- Promotion Effectiveness : Customers who churned were more likely to have received promotion E, suggesting its ineffectiveness in retaining customers. However,  the highest churn segment did not receive any promotion.
- Reasons for Churn : Competition was a significant churn driver, with customers citing "better device and promotion offers" from competitors. Additionally, Product dissatisfaction and negative experiences with support personnel were also contributing factors.
- Geographic Churn Trends : Cities in Western America, specifically San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, showed the highest churn rates. This suggests a potential regional pattern requiring further investigation.
