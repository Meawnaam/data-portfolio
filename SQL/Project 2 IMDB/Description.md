# SQL : IMDB database

This project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL through a series of queries aimed at extracting insights from the Kaggle dataset, [IMDB (SQL)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luizpaulodeoliveira/imdb-project-sql). The focus is on showcasing my ability to navigate various levels of SQL complexity

The exploration begins with fundamental concepts like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions. I then progress to intermediate techniques involving CASE WHEN statements, joins (including inner joins and potentially outer joins if applicable), and advance to subqueries and window functions.

Through this structured approach, I aim to illustrate my understanding of SQL's capabilities and my ability to apply them effectively to analyze data.
