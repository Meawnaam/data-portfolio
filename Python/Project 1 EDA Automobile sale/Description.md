# Exploratory data analysis : Automobile sale
In this project, I used dataset kaggle [Automobile sale](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ddosad/auto-sales-data/data)

## Key insight from analysis
**1. Product Category Performance**: Classic cars emerged as the top-selling category, generating $3,842,868 in revenue.

**2. Deal Size Analysis**: Medium-sized deals were the most frequent, occurring 1,349 times with an average revenue of $4,396.

**3. Customer Geolocation**: While the top three customer countries were USA, Spain, and France, Madrid stood out as the leading city in terms of sales volume.

**4. Seasonal Trends**: A significant sales increase was observed in March, July, and August of 2024 compared to the same period in 2018 and 2019. Further investigation is recommended to understand the driving factors behind this seasonal pattern.

**5. Product Category Trends**: Classic cars, motorcycles, planes, and ships exhibited strong sales performance. Conversely, sales figures for other categories declined year-over-year.

**6. Customer Retention**: Cohort analysis revealed a trend of infrequent repeat purchases, potentially due to the long-term ownership nature of vehicles (typically replaced every 5+ years). Despite this, overall sales demonstrated consistent annual growth.
