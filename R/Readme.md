## Building SPC (Statiscal process control) chart by using R programming

Hi There!
You can find this project in my personal website via this link
[การสร้าง Statistical process control (SPC) chart โดยใช้ R Programming](https://sealdata.wordpress.com/2023/10/29/building-spc-chart-by-r-programming/#building-spc-chart-by-qcc-library)

In my current job as chemist, I'm the person who coordinate with business partner to control production of compounding polymer, so I implement statiscal process control to control my produection expecting that to get smooth operation and stable product quality. 

I use R programming which contain qcc library to build the SPC chart, tidyverse to clean and prepare data, as well as use box plot to filter not too much spread data. Moreover, I create the fuction to automatically build each SPC chart of each grade. This work might be useful for everyone who want to deploy SPC to their process.
