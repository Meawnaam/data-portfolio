In my role as a chemist, I'm passionate about ensuring smooth production and consistent product quality. To achieve this, I spearheaded a project implementing Statistical Process Control (SPC) to monitor our compounding polymer production.

Leveraging the power of R programming, I utilized the ```qcc``` library to generate informative SPC charts. Additionally, I employed the ```tidyverse``` package for efficient data cleaning and preparation. To identify trends and filter out outliers, I incorporated box plots into the analysis.

Furthermore, I streamlined the process by developing a custom function that automatically generates SPC charts for each product grade. This innovation not only improves efficiency but also ensures consistency in our quality control measures.

Believing this approach can benefit others, I'm eager to share my project's potential for anyone looking to deploy SPC in their own processes.
